This is a website which looks to help summer (tech) interns find roommates in common intern locations
(Bay area, Seattle area, etc). MonkeyHouse does this by first prompting first-time users to fill out a
survey with their preferences/details and then showing users people who match them in a grid-style,
and also by offering an in-house direct messaging mechanism to allow users to coordinate plans.
